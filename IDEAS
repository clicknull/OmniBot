This is just a file for future ideas, features, etc

So far the plugins have worked quite well for the OmniBot.main() features. But I'm thinking some 
standards are in order. First of all there should be initial and ending plugins that either
hook into parts of the end of the Category/module they are enhancing or the beginning. In this
way the return values can be manipulated OR the initial settings can be modified. We're considering
to extend this to classes but I'm looking into this as python isn't my first language. So essentially
what we have seen for main() so far is:
    PLUGINS_OMNIBOT_MAIN[0:x].main() functions
    but then we should also see something like
    PLUGINS_OMNIBOT_MAIN[0:x].end() functions checked upon? 

I'm not sure this is my first time extending plugin functionality to a program but we'll see how it goes

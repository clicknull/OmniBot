Omnibot
Author: pasv (pasvninja@gmail.com)

Omnibot will be a nextgen (lol) bot program written in a combination of languages but the underlying system will 
most likely be written in python. There will be an extensive plugin framework that will allow the coder to edit
any part of the code. The main modules will be Auth, Comm,

The OmniBot model will be flexible in that it should be virtually protocol independent. We intend to support AIM,
IRC, HTTP(s), and then perhaps more application specific protocols like twitter and facebook.

The Comm model will be embued with an encryption thru and through. A majority of this encryption will be Base64'd
AES256. Ideally we'd like to see the keytransfer happen out of band (SMS, email) if not we might be able to
implement a public key model but this is well into the future.

The Omnibots capabilities will be limited only to that of the imagination of coders that create the plugins. This
is designed primarily as a developer toy and as such it should not be used to control particularly sensitive 
systems. 


Test branch will be used primarily until we have a working version which will go into the master. I originally
just used the master branch as a test but I need to branch out..
